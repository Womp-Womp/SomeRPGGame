# AstraRPG Brainstorming

A running list of entertaining, scope-friendly features. Prioritize deterministic cores with flavorful presentation.

## Shortlist (High Fun / Low Risk)
- Zone travel with ASCII mini-map (grid, landmarks, hazards)
- Deterministic shop stock with rotating offers (3â€“4 choices)
- Fishing mini-game with timing or pattern matching
- Lightweight bestiary: discover monsters, unlock flavor blurbs
- Loot shrines: pick 1 of 3 choices, seeded outcomes

## Mid-term
- Farming genetics UI: alleles -> phenotype hints
- Base-building layers: place/toggle objects with adjacency bonuses
- Pet taming/breeding with simple trait inheritance

## Spicy (Later)
- Zone hazards (weather, darkness) that alter rolls
- Skill tree unlock lines with ASCII visualization
- Event chains: short narratives with deterministic branches

## Notes
- Keep commands symmetric for CLI and Discord.
- Tests first: every feature shippable with meaningful tests.
